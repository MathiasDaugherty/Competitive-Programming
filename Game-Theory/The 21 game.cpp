/**
    Name: The 21 game

    Description: The game "21" is played as a mis√®re game with any number of players who take turns saying a number.
                 The first player says "1" and each player in turn increases the number by 1, 2, or 3, but may not exceed 21;
                 the player forced to say "21" loses

    Strategy: The winning strategy for the two-player version of this game is to always say a multiple of 4;
              it is then guaranteed that the other player will ultimately have to say 21.
