/**
    Name: Wythoff's game

    Description: Wythoff's game is a two-player mathematical game of strategy, played with two piles of counters.
                 Players take turns removing counters from one or both piles; in the latter case, the numbers of
                 counters removed from each pile must be equal.
                 The game ends when one person removes the last counter or counters, thus winning.

    Strategy:
        Cold position (n,m):  nk = floor( k * phi );
                              mk = floor( k * phi ^ 2 );
**/

const double phi = 1.618033988749;

int main()
{
    int n, m;

    for ( int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i )
        cout << (int)( i * phi ) << " " << (int)( i * phi * phi ) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
